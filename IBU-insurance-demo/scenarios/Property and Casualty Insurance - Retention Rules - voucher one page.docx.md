**Voucher rule (AC-HOME-CONT-VOUCHER)**

A **voucher** should be offered to customers in the following situation:

- Their policy **does not cover the content**, only home structures;  
- The reason of their interaction is that they are **not satisfied** with the applied coverages;  
- Their **CLTV percentile is at least** **60**.

The market value of the voucher should be up to 200€ and can be used with one of our affiliate providers.

This can be applied to cleaning, repair services, etc.

**Example of application of the voucher rule \- water damage scenario:**

* Water damage inside an individual house due to a broken pipe  
* Insurance expert has established that the insurance policy does not cover damaged carpets (stains)  
* The customer is unsatisfied with the coverages and explains that these carpets have sentimental value  
* The customer is highly profitable so it is worth making an effort with a voucher providing good value to the customer.
