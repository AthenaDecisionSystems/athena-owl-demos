### Handling complaint about reimbursed amount related to high deductible (RA-DED-UP)

In the following situation: a customer with a high CLTV percentile (at least 50) complains about the reimbursed amount and the deductible on his claims is at least 120â‚¬ and the propensity to upgrade the policy is at least 0.4

The following actions need to be performed: 
- First reassign to a claims expert and tell client to call back after 8 business days if no news (this is to examine the reimbursed amount in more details)
- Once the claims expert has reassessed the claims, reassign the complaint to a SpecializedClientRepresentative suggesting "a policy upgrade to avoid deductibles" ;
