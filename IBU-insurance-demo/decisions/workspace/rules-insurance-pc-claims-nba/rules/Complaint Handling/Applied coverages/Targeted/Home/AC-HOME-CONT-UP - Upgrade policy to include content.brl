# Upsell rule (AC-HOME-CONT-UP)
An upsell to the home policy should be proposed to customers in the following situation:
- Their policy covers only house structure, not the content;
- They recently said they are not satisfied with the applied coverage;
- The customerâ€™s propensity to upgrade is at least 0.4.

Thanks to this upsell, the customer will avoid similar problems next time.
